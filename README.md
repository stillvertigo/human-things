Project Name - Their Story (may change later on)

Project Page - https://github.com/stillvertigo/human-things

Instructions - Text based choices  are provided to the player, the player chooses from the set amount, these choices determine the end of the game and how the game progresses.

Tools - Visual Studios, no external .NET libraries as of yet.

Concepts - Text-based, a look at three specific characters throughout history (Greek, Roman, Egyptian)

Assumptions - Since it is mostly text-based (aside from a few graphics we hope to add), it will hopefully run quite fast, without any significant lag.

Limitations - Our limitations are a lack of C# coding skills and a limited access to Visual Studios (one group member can not run it on her laptop, thus she has to rely on the Hamilton labs). The programs limitations arise from that, as well as its text-based nature limiting much visual output besides text.
